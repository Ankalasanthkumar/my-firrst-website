             <h1> Who is using cloud computing?   </h1> <br>
Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

		    	The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them–from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.

You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.

            	<hr style="border-color: white">
		        <p>
		    		With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.

		        <p>
		    		With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.

            <p>
	            ●	The Internet has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it had any relevance for businesses. <br>
	            ●	he World Wide Web was born in 1991, and in 1993 a web browser called Mosaic was released that allowed users to view web pages that included graphics as well as text. <br>
	            ●	Since then the cloud has grown and grown. In fact, spending on cloud services is estimated to increase exponentially – from nearly $70 billion in 2015 to an estimated $141 billion or more in 2019.<br>

            </time>  How cloud computing works</time> 
            <p>
            	●	With a cloud app, you just open a browser, log in, and start working.

That means a field sales representative using cloud-based CRM can get all the information they need from their mobile device<br>
            	●Contact notes can be updated in real time so they are always fresh and complete and available to others – no more waiting to get back to the office to type it in.	<br>

            <time>Who uses the cloud?</time> 
            <p>
	            ●	The cloud has become so integral to our everyday lives that most people use it without even realising. In fact, for many people, life without the cloud would be radically different.<br>
	    		●	There would be no Facebook, no Twitter, no Gmail, and no Spotify.<br>
	    		●	Companies with over 25,000 employees use an average of 545 cloud apps or services.
As of March 2016 there were on average 1.09 billion daily active users on Facebook worldwide.
Over half of all Internet users rely on cloud-based email services like Gmail and Yahoo! Mail to send and receive their messages.<br>

            	●	No up-front costs<br>
                  ●    Mainteinance free

            <p>
	            ●	The issues of cloud security and privacy play an important role in the digital era, particularly since data is not filed in folders and physically archived in an office building. Every day, millions of new records are generated and stored digitally in the cloud.<br><br>

            <time>What is the future of cloud computing?</time>
            <p>
            	●	Cloud computing is reaching the point where it is likely to account for more of enterprise tech spending than the traditional forms of delivering applications and services in-house that have been around for decades. However, use of the cloud is only likely to climb as organisations get more comfortable with the idea of their data being somewhere other than a server in the basement. And now cloud-computing vendors are increasingly pushing cloud computing as an agent of digital transformation instead of focusing simply on cost. <br>

The three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management so that you can select the right set of services.

<h4> AWS-Types-of-Cloud-Computing_Infrastructure-as-a-Service-N </h4> 
<h4> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </h4><br>
<p> IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar. </p>


<h4> AWS-Types-of-Cloud-Computing_Platform-as-a-Service-N  <br>
Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
</h4> <br>
PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 

<h4> AWS-Types-of-Cloud-Computing_Software-as-a-Service-N
Software as a Service (SaaS) </h4>  <br>
SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.
